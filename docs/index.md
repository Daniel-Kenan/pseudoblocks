pseudo code is case insentive but still requires user to be case sensitive on variables.
This program was designed to help assist students run algorithms written with pseudo code with providing an isolated environment.So they can better understand and grasp programming concepts  with ease.Students will better understand the commandline interface

To learn more about syntax it is highly advised you read [Just Enough Programming Logic and Design 2nd Edition](https://pdfhost.io/v/csFeVPBzn_Just_Enough_Programming_Logic_and_Design_2nd_Edition)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
