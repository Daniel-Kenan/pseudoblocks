For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Daniel-Kenan/pseudo-blocks/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
